<h1>The Best Movies According to Nishant</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Spirited Away</h3>
<pre>
  My favorite anime movie.Spirited Away tells the story of Chihiro Ogino
  (Hiiragi), a ten-year-old girl who, while moving to a new neighborhood, enters
  the world of kami (spirits of Japanese Shinto folklore)
</pre>
<h3>Ex Machina</h3>
<pre>
  The visual effects around the Ava character are seamless, and the human
  characters are believable and fascinating, with strong performances by
  everyone involved. Ex Machina achieves that rare combination of eliciting both
  strong thoughts and feelings, and it deserves to be known as a sci-fi classic.
</pre>
<h3>A Beautiful Mind</h3>
<pre>
  A Beautiful Mind is an emotional biopic about Nobel-winning mathematician John
  Nash, and it's riddled with deviations from the true story. A Beautiful Mind
  dramatizes the true story of mathematician John Nash, a Nobel Laureate in
  Economics who was known for his pioneering contributions to game theory.
