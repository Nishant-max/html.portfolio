    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>In a non-reactive bowl, combine ¾ cup milk substitute, garbanzo flour, sorghum flour, yeast, first measure of sugar, and cider vinegar.  Mix well.  Cover bowl and set aside for 2 to 4 hours. </li>
            <li>In the mixing bowl of a heavy-duty mixer, beat eggs until frothy.  Add oil, blend.  Add garbanzo flour mixture and stir well.  Whisk corn starch, potato starch, tapioca starch, second measure of sugar, xanthan or guar gum and salt together in a separate bowl.  Add dry ingredients to wet, mix well on low speed until all ingredients are incorporated.  Check texture of dough.  If needed, add 1 Tablespoon of milk substitute at a time until the correct texture is achieved (not too stiff, not soupy – thick and sticky).  Beat at high speed for 3 minutes. Mix melted margarine, brown sugar, and 2 ground cinnamon together.  Set aside</li>
            <li>Lay two 18” lengths on plastic wrap on the counter, overlaying slightly on the long edges.  Oil plastic wrap.  Scoop dough onto center of plastic wrap.  Using well oiled hands, gently pat dough into a  rectangle (about 1/3-1/2 inch thick) with the closest edge to you about 18” wide.  Carefully spread brown sugar/cinnamon mixture onto dough, leaving a ½ plain edge of dough along the edge of the rectangle furthest from you.  Using the plastic wrap to support the dough, start rolling dough enclosing cinnamon nut mixture.  Wet edge of dough to seal.  Using a clean piece of dental floss cut dough into 16 pieces.  (Slide dental floss under the dough, cross the dental floss over the top of the dough and pull cutting through the dough.)  Place rolls in pan cut side down on sugar mixture.  Cover pan with oiled plastic wrap and allow to raise for 20-30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove plastic wrap and bake in a preheated 375 degree oven for 30-35 minutes until golden brown.  After rolls have cooled slightly or completely (depends on your preference), drizzle with a glaze made of powdered sugar and second measure of milk substitute of choice. </li>
